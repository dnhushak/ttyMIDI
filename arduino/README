To install the Arduino ttymidi library (which I so aptly named "ardumidi"),
just copy the ttymidi folder into the Arduino libraries folder:

cp -r ardumidi /path/to/arduino/sketchbook/libraries/

This library comes with example sketches. Please take
a look at them, as they contains information on how to use the library.
