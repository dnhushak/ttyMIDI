To install the Arduino ttymidi library (which I so aptly named "ardumidi"),
just copy the ttymidi folder into the Arduino libraries folder:

cp -r ardumidi /path/to/arduino/hardware/libraries/

An example sketch is included in the file called ardumidi_test.pde . Please take
a look at it, as it contains information on how to use the library.
